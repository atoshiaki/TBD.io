## Description

Our team built our first full-stack web application. We designed and built an app using the MVC paradigm and our own server-side API. We integrated Sequelize, a popular Node.js ORM, into our newly modularized application. We also continued to add to our professional repertoire with testing, continuous integration and linting tools.

In this app, user can search any live video from the search area. When user inserts the name or title of video to the search area, related videos will be called from Youtube with an API Key and user can add any of them to their database after calling them to the app. They can mark as watched and can remove from app any of them. They can build this app as a big video library.
